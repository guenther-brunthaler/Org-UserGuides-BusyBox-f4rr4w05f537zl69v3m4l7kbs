BusyBox udhcpc
==============

This is a DHCP client which runs a script ("/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script" by default) whenever DHCP events occur.

The script is passed information via exported environment variables as well as via its first argument.

Possible first arguments:

deconfig
leasefail
bound
renew
nak

Environment variables:
interface=IFACE
ip=N.N.N.N
siaddr=IP # IP address of next server to use in bootstrap
boot_file=FILE
sname=SERVER_HOSTNAME
mask=UINT # Hmmm ... subnet mask as an integer?
opt$UINT=$HEXSTRING

'router' option [21]

Your ISP better supply the "ip" and "subnet" 
variables or all of this is for not. 
"router", "dns", "lease" should be there also
along with a few others.

OPTION_STATIC_ROUTES
"IP/MASK ROUTER IP2/MASK2 ROUTER2"

#define DHCP_ROUTES           0x21
#define DHCP_ROUTER           0x03
#define DHCP_DNS_SERVER       0x06

It seems the script only needs to do the following things:

* Set $router as the default gateway

* Set up $dns as the address of the DNS server
