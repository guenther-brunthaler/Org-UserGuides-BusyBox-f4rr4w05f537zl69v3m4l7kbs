BusyBox udhcpc
==============
v2021.310

This is a DHCP client which runs a script ("/usr/share/udhcpc/default.script" by default, but can be overridden with the "-s" option) whenever DHCP events occur.

If you don't have a script, the following one might prove useful:

#! /bin/sh
exec > /tmp/dhcp.dump
date
env


The script is passed information via exported environment variables as well as via its first argument.

Strangely, it seems that udhcpc actually sets *more* variables than less when specifying the "-o" option. It is therefore recommended to do this.

Possible first script arguments:

deconfig
leasefail
bound
renew
nak


Environment variables (normally set):

interface=IFACE
ip=N.N.N.N # IP address of client
subnet=N.N.N.N # subnet mask
broadcast=N.N.N.N # broadcast address
siaddr=IP # IP address of next server to use in bootstrap
boot_file=/path/to/tftp/boot/FILE
serverid=N.N.N.N # IP address of DHCP server
mask=UINT # length of network prefix in $ip as number of bits


Environment variables (may also be set):

sname=NAME # hostname of DHCP server
router=N.N.N.N # IP address of default gateway
domain=DNS_NAME # FQDN for network of $sname
dns=N.N.N.N # DNS server to be used
lease=UINT # remaining lease time in seconds, (2^32)-1 for infinite
hostname=FQDN # hostname of client within $domain
opt$UINT=$HEXSTRING (all remaining DHCP options)


'router' option [21]

Your ISP better supply the "ip" and "subnet" 
variables or all of this is for nothing.

OPTION_STATIC_ROUTES
"IP/MASK ROUTER IP2/MASK2 ROUTER2"

#define DHCP_ROUTES           0x21
#define DHCP_ROUTER           0x03
#define DHCP_DNS_SERVER       0x06

It seems the script only needs to do the following things:

* Set $router as the default gateway

* Set up $dns as the address of the DNS server
