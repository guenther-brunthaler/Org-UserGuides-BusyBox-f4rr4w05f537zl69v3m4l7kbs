The "man" applet of BB is next to useless: It just tries to 
invoke the full nroff/troff toolchain as the original "man" 
would.

It has no ability at all to replace the heavyweight tools of that 
toolchain and format the man pages itself somehow.

My impression is that if a system installation is large enough to 
host the 12 MB troff toolchain, then it is also large enough to 
host the original "man" utility - no BB version of it needed at 
all.
