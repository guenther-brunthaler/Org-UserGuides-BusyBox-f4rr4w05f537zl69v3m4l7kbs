dnsd
====

BusyBox dnsd is an authoritative IPv4 DNS server for isolated networks which cannot forward queries it cannot answer to other DNS servers.

Its configuration file, normally "/etc/dnsd.conf", contains simple space-separated $NAME $IPv4_ADDRESS pairs separated by sequences of spaces, tabs, or newlines. Empty lines will thus be ignored. A "#" starts a comment that extends to the end of the line and is handled as if it were whitespace.

Multiple names can be used for the same IP-address, allowing alias names to be defined.

Names may also contain dots, allowing to resolve structured DNS names comprised of several name components.

BusyBox dnsd is *not* useful for resolving some DNS names and forwarding all other names to fallback DNS servers.
