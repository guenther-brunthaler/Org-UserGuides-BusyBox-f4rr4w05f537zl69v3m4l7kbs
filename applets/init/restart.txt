The following steps assume BusyBox init has been configured to read its
configuration from /run/inittab rather than from /etc/inittab.

In order to re-exec init:

$ cat inittab > /run/inittab
$ cp nterm /run/
$ kill -HUP 1 # Reload inittab; spawn tty8
$ kill -QUIT 1 # Will re-exec, only tty8 left after this.

On tty8, go to THIS dir then launch up services.

A crucial point to understand re-exec of init is that init will kill
any other running processed other than itself before restarting.

This means any other shells running at the moment when init receives
SIGQUIT will be killed as well.

The only way how to make sure a shell will be available after
re-exec'ing init is to start one from the new init's inittab.
