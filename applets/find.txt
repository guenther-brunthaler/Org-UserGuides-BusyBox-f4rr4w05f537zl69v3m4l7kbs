-delete         [NPX] Delete current file/directory. Turns on -depth option

BusyBox "find" DOES NOT implement the following actions required by POSIX.1-2008:

-atime DAYS     [MISSING] atime is greater than (+N), less than (-N),
                or exactly N days in the past
-ctime DAYS     [MISSING] ctime is greater than (+N), less than (-N),
                or exactly N days in the past
-nouser         [MISSING] file belongs to a user ID for which the getpwuid() function returns NULL
-nogroup        [MISSING] file belongs to a user ID for which the getgrgid() function returns NULL
-ok CMD ARG ;   [MISSING] Like -exec but without support for the "+" sign, and the user is prompted to agree before every execution of CMD.
