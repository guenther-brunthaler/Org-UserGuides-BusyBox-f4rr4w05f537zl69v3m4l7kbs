SIGHUP makes BusyBox inetd reload its configuration file.

SIGTERM and SIGINT instruct BusyBox inetd to shut itself down ASAP.

As of 2016-09, BusyBox inetd performs I/O operations within signal handlers,
which can lead to problems and is not allowed by POSIX.

Better use the real BSD inetd if you can and code size does not matter that
much.

However, BB inetd worked for me all the time in practice. OTOH, I didn' run it
on a heavily loaded server system.
