klogd
=====

klogd reads the kernel log and sends it to the currently running syslog daemon. It should therefore be started *after* syslogd - not before it!

The -c N parameter makes the kernel print kernel messages more urgent than N to the system console, i. e. screwing up your screen in most cases.

"More urgent" means here, messages with a higher priority (= a lower numberical value) will be printed to the console.

As allowed values for N range from 1 to 8, -c 8 prints everything and -c 1 prints only emergencies (which cannot be disabled).

Otherwise, the following priority levels are defined:

0 ("emerg"): system is unusable.
1 ("alert"): action must be taken immediately.
2 ("crit"): critical conditions.
3 ("err"): error conditions.
4 ("warning"): warning conditions.
5 ("notice"): normal but significant condition.
6 ("info"): informational.
7 ("debug"): debug-level messages.

If -c is not specified at all, the current kernel console log level is simply not changed from its current value.

See "man klogctl" for more details about the kernel's console logging level.

In order to disable console logging completely, a different approach than using the -c option is recommended: Start klog without the -c option ans use
dmsg to disable all console logging:

$ dmsg -D
$ klogd
