crontab-Files Format
====================

The crontab files are read using the normal BusyBox configuration file parser, and thus allow the usual comments and empty lines.

Otherwise, lines starting "SHELL=" and "MAILTO=" (only if configures) lines are explcitly handled; it remains unclear whether spaces around the "=" are also accepted, or whether other environment variables can be set as well.

Except for comment/assignment-lines, all crontab-lines are structured as 6 whitespace-separated fields on each line as follows:

* Minutes (0-59)

* Hours (0-23)

* Days (1-31)

* Months (1-12 or 3-letter lower case abbreviation)

* Days of Week (0 = sunday or 3-letter lower case abbreviation)

* The command to execute if the beforementioned fields match the current date and time

Except for the command field, all of the above fields support the following additional features (from highest to lowerst operator precedence):

"*" includes all possible values in the set of matching values for this field, i. e. this field will matches every date/time value.

"<from>-<to>" includes all values for the field in ascending order between <from> and <to> (both boundary values inclusive).

"<range>/<skip>" reduces the selected values from a range to its first value and then every <skipth>th value after that. For instance "3-9/2" selects only values 3, 5, 7 and 9 for inclusion.

"<entryN>,<entryN+1>" allows to specify multiple value ranges (which may include skips) for the field which will all be included.

Using the above syntax, all value fields in a crontab line represent arrays of all possible values, where every array value represents a boolean whether this value will be selected or deselected for matching the current date/time.

If the values representing the current/date time matches for *all* fields of a crontab entry line, the associated command will be run.

Here is an example crontab which runs a no-op command every minute:

#                     1-12 or  0-6 or
# 0-59    0-23  1-31  Jan-Dec  Sun-Sat
# Minute  Hour  Day   Month    DOW      Command
  *       *     *     *        *        true
