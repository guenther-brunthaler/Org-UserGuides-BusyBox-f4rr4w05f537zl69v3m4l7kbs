The following steps assume BusyBox init has been configured to read its
configuration from /run/inittab rather than from /etc/inittab.

It will stop init and replace it with a PID 1 shell on tty8.

In order to stop init and replace it by a shell:

$ cat inittab.stop > /run/inittab
$ cp nterm /run/
$ kill -HUP 1 # Reload inittab
$ kill -QUIT 1 # Will exec /run/nterm.

On tty8, go to THIS dir then launch up services.

A crucial point to understand re-exec of init is that init will kill
any other running processes other than itself before restarting.

This means any other shells running at the moment when init receives
SIGQUIT will be killed as well.
